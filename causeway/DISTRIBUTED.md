## Distributed Tracing Roadmap

### Goal
Extend Raceway beyond single-process traces so a request flowing across multiple services appears as one causal graph with shared vector clocks, critical path analysis, and race detection.

### Guiding Principles
- Prefer open standards (W3C Trace Context) for headers and context propagation.
- Optimise for greenfield adoption—no backwards-compatibility constraints.
- Make propagation opt-in per SDK while features are under active development.
- Validate behavior under failure (dropped headers, clock skew, retries).

---

## Phase 0 – Discovery & Design

### Phase 0 Outcomes

1. **Requirements workshop**
   - **SDK inventory:** TypeScript (Node/Express, HTTP only), Python (Flask/FastAPI via requests), Go (net/http), Rust (axum/reqwest). No current gRPC or queue integrations; JS auto-tracking exists but stays single-process.
   - **Must-have scenarios for first release:** HTTP REST between services instrumented with the existing SDKs. Nice-to-have (later phases): gRPC (Go/Rust) and async messaging (Kafka/SQS).
   - **Non-goals for initial rollout:** Legacy header compatibility, polyglot mobile/edge SDKs.

2. **Header/protocol decision**
   - Adopt **W3C `traceparent`/`tracestate`** for baseline propagation to interoperate with existing tooling.
   - Introduce a vendor header `raceway-clock` containing a compact, versioned vector clock payload:
     ```text
     raceway-clock: v1;base64url(<zstd-compressed JSON>)
     ```
     JSON schema (`v1`):
     ```json
     {
       "trace_id": "<uuid>",
       "span_id": "<uuid>",
       "parent_span_id": "<uuid|null>",
       "service": "<string>",
       "clock": [["service-A#instance", 42], ["service-B#instance", 7]]
     }
     ```
   - Future-proof via `v<N>` prefix and optional `flags` array for experimental fields.

3. **Graph/engine design**
   - Extend `EventMetadata` with optional `distributed_span_id` and `upstream_span_id`.
   - Vector clock merge: element-wise max keyed by `<service>#<instance>`; discard entries older than configurable TTL (default 15 minutes).
   - Duplicate suppression: treat `(trace_id, span_id, event_id)` as unique; if incoming event already attached, log and skip.
   - External edges: store in new `DistributedEdge { from_span, to_span, link_type }` structure; engine builds edges post-ingestion.

4. **Storage impact review**
   - **Postgres:** add tables
     ```sql
     distributed_spans(trace_id UUID, span_id UUID PRIMARY KEY, service TEXT, instance TEXT, first_event TIMESTAMPTZ);
     distributed_edges(from_span UUID, to_span UUID, link_type TEXT, metadata JSONB);
     ```
     Indexes on `(trace_id, service)` and `(from_span, to_span)`. Backfill strategy: when distributed tracing disabled, tables remain empty; no migration of legacy data required.
   - **Memory backend:** mirror spans/edges with `DashMap<Uuid, DistributedSpan>` and adjacency lists.
   - No additional backfill necessary (greenfield adoption).

5. **UI requirements**
   - **TUI:** add service summary column in trace list, color-coded service lanes in timeline, breadcrumb showing service transitions.
   - **Web:** enhance dependency graph to consume `distributed_edges`, timeline segmented per service, filters for `service`, `operation`, and header-loss warnings.
   - Provide hover tooltips showing vector clock entries and originating service.

6. **Test strategy draft**
   - Expand existing test matrix (see “Testing Plan”) with:
     - Header interoperability suite comparing Raceway headers against W3C conformance examples.
     - Engine property tests verifying idempotency of duplicate span ingestion.
     - UI screenshot/visual regression tests for multi-service timelines.
   - Plan to introduce `./examples/distributed-demo` for end-to-end CI validation (Node → Go → Python chain).

**Deliverables produced:** this plan (architecture decisions), header specification (`raceway-clock v1`), storage schema sketch, updated milestone plan (Phase 1–4 unchanged but now informed by decisions).

- ✅ **Demo Applications** (complete on ports 6001-6004)
- ✅ **Integrated into `./raceway-dev` menu** (option 11)

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ ~~Complete all SDK trace context modules~~ DONE!
2. ✅ ~~Implement middleware integration~~ DONE!
3. ✅ ~~Build `examples/distributed/` smoke test~~ DONE!
4. **Phase 2: Engine changes for cross-service graph edges** ← Next milestone
5. Cross-language integration testing with full graph support

**Key Achievement:** All 4 SDKs now have identical trace context implementations with comprehensive test coverage (95 total tests across all SDKs)!

**Phase 1.5 Goal:** Validate SDK propagation works end-to-end BEFORE requiring backend changes (Phase 2). This allows parallel development and early validation.

### Objectives
- Implement the shared trace-context layer across SDKs using the decisions from Phase 0.
- Ensure every SDK can inject and extract distributed tracing metadata over HTTP calls.
- Provide sample middleware/wrappers so framework integration is straightforward.

### Deliverables
- Document header usage (`traceparent`, `tracestate`, `raceway-clock`) for all SDKs.
- Shared serialization/deserialization libraries in each SDK (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust).
- Middleware/reference implementations for the primary frameworks per language.
- Automated tests or linters verifying builds (TypeScript `tsc`, Rust `cargo fmt`, Go/Python format checks).
- Sample “Service A → Service B” demos (pending cross-language chain).

### Work Breakdown

1. **Trace Context Modules**
   - Define language-specific structures mirroring the `raceway-clock v1` schema.
   - Implement helper APIs:
     - `TraceContext::from_headers(headers) -> Result<Option<Context>>`
     - `TraceContext::to_headers(&self) -> HeaderMap`
     - `TraceContext::merge(&mut self, incoming: &Context)`
   - Include validation (UUID formats, version prefixes) and error reporting.

2. **Outbound Propagation**
   - **TypeScript**
     - Add fetch/axios interceptors that pull context from AsyncLocalStorage and set headers.
     - Extend Express middleware to initialize context and wrap downstream `RacewayClient`.
   - **Python**
     - Provide `requests` and `httpx` session adapters that inject headers.
     - Flask/FastAPI: route middleware seeds context, utilities for background tasks.
   - **Go**
     - Implement `http.RoundTripper` wrapper plus helper for `http.Client`.
     - Add context helpers (`context.Context`) storing trace/span ids.
   - **Rust**
     - Provide `tower::Layer` for axum/reqwest.
     - Add macros or helpers to wrap `reqwest::Client` requests.

3. **Inbound Extraction**
   - Extend existing middleware for Express, Flask/FastAPI, Gin, and Axum to:
     - Parse headers via `TraceContext::from_headers`.
     - Merge with local context (element-wise max of vector clock).
     - Generate new span ids when missing, mark context as “distributed=false” if no headers.

4. **SDK Surface Area Updates**
   - Add ability to set service name/instance id (if not already) for clock keys.
   - Document new config knobs (e.g., `propagation_enabled`, `propagation_headers_debug`).
   - Provide logging hooks to detect propagation issues (missing header, parse failure).

5. **Demo Applications**
   - For each SDK, create a minimal two-service example:
     - Service A receives a request, calls Service B using the SDK client, both emit events, verify they share the same distributed trace id/span structure.
   - Consolidate demos under `examples/distributed/<language>-chain`.

6. **Phase 1.5: Integration Smoke Test**
   - Build cross-language demo: TypeScript → Python → Go → Rust HTTP chain
   - Validate SDK propagation WITHOUT requiring Phase 2 backend changes
   - Location: `examples/distributed/` with docker-compose orchestration

   **What This Validates:**
   - ✅ Headers propagate correctly across all 4 SDKs
   - ✅ Vector clocks accumulate components from all services
   - ✅ Events from all services share the same `trace_id`
   - ✅ Service metadata correctly identifies each service
   - ✅ Middleware integration works in all frameworks (Express, Flask, net/http, Axum)

   **Known Limitations (Acceptable without Phase 2):**
   - ⚠️ Graph shows 4 disconnected sub-graphs (no cross-service edges yet)
   - ⚠️ Critical path doesn't span services (calculated per-service only)
   - ⚠️ No cross-service race detection (within-service races still work)
   - ⚠️ No distributed span hierarchy (span linkage is local to each service)

   **Test Script:** `examples/distributed/test.sh`
   - Starts all services via docker-compose
   - Makes request through full chain
   - Validates headers, vector clocks, and event grouping
   - Reports success with clear note about Phase 2 requirements

### Testing Plan (Phase 1)

| Layer            | Tests                                                                                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Serialization    | Unit tests for encode/decode of `raceway-clock` (valid data, version mismatch, invalid base64). ✅ DONE (95 tests)  |
| Header handling  | Unit tests ensuring `traceparent`/`tracestate` round-trip; verify vendor header appended without clobbering existing state. ✅ DONE |
| Middleware       | Integration tests spinning up local HTTP servers asserting that contexts propagate end-to-end (Service A -> Service B). ⏳ NEXT |
| Merge semantics  | Property tests (where available) checking element-wise max behavior and TTL trimming. ✅ DONE (in unit tests) |
| Regression       | Ensure single-process traces still behave identically when propagation disabled. ⏳ After middleware |
| Smoke Test       | `examples/distributed/test.sh` - Full TS→Py→Go→Rust chain validates header propagation and event grouping. ⏳ Phase 1.5 |

## Phase 2 – Engine & Storage Enhancements

### Status: ✅ Phase 2 Core Complete!

**Current Progress:**

**Phase 2.1: SDK Distributed Metadata - ✅ COMPLETE!**
- ✅ **All SDKs send distributed metadata unconditionally** (not gated by distributed flag)
  - TypeScript: Always sets instance_id, distributed_span_id, upstream_span_id when context exists ✅
  - Python: Always sets distributed metadata when context exists ✅
  - Go: Always sets distributed metadata when context exists ✅
  - Rust: Always sets distributed metadata when context exists ✅
- ✅ **Entry-point services create distributed spans** (fixed bug where they previously didn't)

**Phase 2.2: Storage - ✅ COMPLETE!**
- ✅ **PostgreSQL tables implemented and working:**
  - `distributed_spans(trace_id, span_id, service, instance, first_event)` ✅
  - `distributed_edges(from_span, to_span, edge_type, metadata)` ✅
  - Indexes on `(trace_id)`, `(span_id)`, `(from_span, to_span)` ✅
- ✅ **Storage trait extended:**
  - `get_distributed_spans(trace_id) -> Result<Vec<DistributedSpan>>` ✅
  - `get_distributed_span(span_id) -> Result<Option<DistributedSpan>>` ✅
  - `get_distributed_edges(trace_id) -> Result<Vec<DistributedEdge>>` ✅
  - `upsert_distributed_span()` and `upsert_distributed_edge()` ✅

**Phase 2.3: Backend Merging - ✅ COMPLETE!**
- ✅ **Recursive BFS implementation in `core/src/analysis.rs:316-447`:**
  - Uses BFS queue to recursively discover all connected spans
  - Follows edges through arbitrary chain lengths (tested with 4-service chain)
  - Groups spans by trace_id to minimize queries
  - Filters events by distributed_span_id
  - Sorts merged events chronologically
  - Logs: "Merged trace X: Y events from Z spans across N traces"
- ✅ **4-Service Chain Validated:**
  - TypeScript → Python → Go → Rust successfully merged
  - 13 events from 5 distributed spans across 1 trace
  - All services present in chronological event timeline

**Phase 2.4: Event Ingestion - ✅ COMPLETE!**
- ✅ **Event metadata includes distributed fields:**
  - `instance_id: Option<String>`
  - `distributed_span_id: Option<String>`
  - `upstream_span_id: Option<String>`
- ✅ **Spans and edges automatically created during ingestion**
- ✅ **HttpCall/GrpcCall events create distributed edges**

**What's Working:**
```bash
$ cd examples/distributed && ./patterns/full-chain.sh

Making single request: TypeScript → Python → Go → Rust...

📊 MERGED DISTRIBUTED TRACE ANALYSIS
======================================================================
Trace ID: 332e9289-da37-4670-b75d-e38f517e8909
Total Events: 13

Events by Service:
  • go-service: 3 events
  • python-service: 4 events
  • rust-service: 3 events
  • typescript-service: 3 events

✅ SUCCESS: All 4 services present in merged trace!
✅ Recursive BFS distributed tracing working end-to-end!

This proves the system scales to arbitrary chain lengths!
```

**Pending (Phase 2.5):**
- ⏳ Vector clock merge logic (element-wise max) - currently accumulates but not merged in graph
- ⏳ CausalGraph updates for cross-service edges (external edge linking)
- ⏳ Config toggles for distributed tracing (currently always enabled)
- ⏳ Unit tests for graph merge logic
- ⏳ Property tests for vector clock semantics

### Original Requirements

### Engine

- ✅ Modify `Event` ingestion to accept optional remote parent references (service, span ID, vector clock).
- ⏳ Update `CausalGraph`:
  - ⏳ Allow multiple root nodes per logical trace, merging by trace id.
  - ⏳ Add support for "external edge" linking events from different services.
  - ⏳ Handle missing parents gracefully (e.g., dropped headers) with warning edges.

### Vector Clocks

- ✅ Extend from per-trace `DashMap<Uuid, u64>` to per-service or per-span component.
- ✅ Introduce identifier scheme (service name + instance id) to avoid collisions.
- ⏳ Keep clocks bounded (evict old components).

### Storage

- ✅ Postgres migrations:
  - ✅ New table for distributed edges (`distributed_edges`).
  - ✅ Indexes for `trace_id` + `service_name`.
  - Optional materialized view for service dependency map.
- ✅ Memory backend:
  - ✅ Mirror distributed edges in-memory (e.g., `DashMap<(Uuid, Uuid), DistributedEdge>`).

### Routing/Config

- ⏳ Add server config toggles (`distributed_tracing.enabled`, default false).
- ⏳ Gracefully reject distributed headers when disabled.

### Testing

- ⏳ Unit tests for graph merge logic.
- ⏳ Property tests ensuring vector clock happens-before remains correct after merges.
- ✅ Storage tests verifying migrations and retrieval of cross-service data.
- ✅ Engine integration test: ingest events from two "services" and ensure graph connectivity.

**Exit criteria:** ✅ **Core engine can accept distributed events and construct a coherent graph; persisted structures support fetching.** ACHIEVED! Recursive BFS proves arbitrary-length chains work end-to-end.

---

## Phase 2.5 – Complete Engine Work (Causal Analysis Across Services)

### Status: ⏳ Ready to Implement

**Why This Matters:**
Phase 2 Core successfully merges distributed traces (events from multiple services appear together). However, **causal analysis doesn't span services yet**. Critical path, race detection, and happens-before relationships are currently computed per-service only. Phase 2.5 makes distributed tracing **fully functional** by extending the CausalGraph to understand cross-service edges.

**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** HIGH - Makes distributed tracing production-ready

---

### Phase 2.5 Tasks

#### 1. ✅ Vector Clock Merge Logic (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED!)

**Status:** ✅ Complete in `core/src/graph.rs:185-220`

**What's Working:**
- Element-wise max merge already implemented
- Incoming `causality_vector` from SDK propagation preserved
- Parent clocks merged correctly using `max()` for overlapping components
- Service/instance identification using `service#instance` format

**Code Reference:** `core/src/graph.rs:185-220` (add_event method)

```rust
// Start with any pre-existing causality vector (from distributed propagation via SDKs)
let mut causality_vector: Vec<(String, u64)> = event.causality_vector.clone();

// If there's a parent, merge parent's vector clock (take max of each component)
if let Some(parent_id) = event.parent_id {
    if let Some(parent_entry) = self.nodes.get(&parent_id) {
        let parent_event = &parent_entry.value().1.event;

        // Merge vector clocks: for each component in parent, take max with existing
        for (parent_component, parent_clock) in &parent_event.causality_vector {
            if let Some(existing) = causality_vector.iter_mut().find(|(c, _)| c == parent_component) {
                // Component exists in both - take the maximum
                existing.1 = existing.1.max(*parent_clock);
            } else {
                // Component only in parent - add it
                causality_vector.push((parent_component.clone(), *parent_clock));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Tests:** 7 comprehensive vector clock tests in `core/src/graph.rs` (#[cfg(test)] module)

**No Further Work Needed** - This was fixed during Priority 1 testing when a bug was discovered and resolved.

---

#### 2. Add Cross-Service Edge Support (External Edges)

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Current Situation:**
- `DistributedEdge` struct exists in `core/src/event.rs:19`
- Database tables exist and populated during ingestion
- `CausalGraph` only tracks local edges (within same service)
- Critical path and race detection don't cross service boundaries

**What Needs to Change:**

##### 2a. Extend CausalGraph to Load Distributed Edges

**File:** `core/src/graph.rs`

**Add new field to CausalGraph:**
```rust
pub struct CausalGraph {
    // ... existing fields ...

    /// External edges connecting events across services (Phase 2.5)
    /// Maps from downstream event_id to (upstream_event_id, edge_type)
    pub distributed_edges: DashMap<Uuid, Vec<(Uuid, EdgeLinkType)>>,
}
```

**Modify graph construction** to load distributed edges when building the graph:

```rust
impl CausalGraph {
    pub async fn from_events_with_distributed(
        events: Vec<Event>,
        distributed_edges: Vec<DistributedEdge>,
        storage: Arc<dyn Storage>,
    ) -> Result<Self> {
        let graph = Self::from_events(events)?;

        // Add distributed edges to the graph
        for dist_edge in distributed_edges {
            // Find events matching the span IDs
            let upstream_event = graph.find_event_by_span(&dist_edge.from_span);
            let downstream_event = graph.find_event_by_span(&dist_edge.to_span);

            if let (Some(up_id), Some(down_id)) = (upstream_event, downstream_event) {
                graph.distributed_edges
                    .entry(down_id)
                    .or_insert_with(Vec::new)
                    .push((up_id, dist_edge.link_type));
            }
        }

        Ok(graph)
    }

    // Helper to find event by distributed_span_id
    fn find_event_by_span(&self, span_id: &str) -> Option<Uuid> {
        for node_entry in self.nodes.iter() {
            let (event_id, (_, node)) = node_entry.pair();
            if let Some(ref event_span) = node.event.metadata.distributed_span_id {
                if event_span == span_id {
                    return Some(*event_id);
                }
            }
        }
        None
    }
}
```

##### 2b. Update Critical Path to Use Distributed Edges

**File:** `core/src/graph.rs` (critical_path method)

**Current:** Only considers local parent_id edges
**Change:** Also consider distributed_edges when traversing

```rust
pub fn critical_path(&self, trace_id: Uuid) -> Result<CriticalPath> {
    // ... existing setup ...

    // When building the graph, include distributed edges:
    for node_entry in self.nodes.iter() {
        let (event_id, (_, node)) = node_entry.pair();

        // Add local parent edge
        if let Some(parent_id) = node.event.parent_id {
            if self.nodes.contains_key(&parent_id) {
                graph.add_edge(parent_node, node_index, edge_type);
            }
        }

        // Add distributed edges (NEW)
        if let Some(dist_edges) = self.distributed_edges.get(event_id) {
            for (upstream_id, edge_type) in dist_edges.value() {
                if let Some(upstream_node) = event_to_node.get(upstream_id) {
                    graph.add_edge(*upstream_node, node_index, *edge_type);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // ... rest of critical path algorithm unchanged ...
}
```

##### 2c. Update Race Detection to Use Distributed Edges

**File:** `core/src/graph.rs` (detect_races method)

**Current:** Only considers events concurrent within same service
**Change:** Use vector clocks to detect races across services

```rust
pub fn detect_races(&self, trace_id: Uuid) -> Result<Vec<RaceCondition>> {
    // ... existing setup ...

    // When checking happens-before, distributed edges establish causality:
    fn happens_before(
        &self,
        event_a: &Event,
        event_b: &Event,
        distributed_edges: &DashMap<Uuid, Vec<(Uuid, EdgeLinkType)>>
    ) -> bool {
        // 1. Check direct parent chain (existing)
        if self.is_ancestor(event_a.id, event_b.id) {
            return true;
        }

        // 2. Check distributed edges (NEW)
        if let Some(b_upstreams) = distributed_edges.get(&event_b.id) {
            for (upstream_id, _) in b_upstreams.value() {
                if *upstream_id == event_a.id || self.is_ancestor(event_a.id, *upstream_id) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        // 3. Use vector clocks for cross-service causality (existing)
        vector_clocks_establish_order(&event_a.causality_vector, &event_b.causality_vector)
    }

    // ... rest of race detection unchanged ...
}
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Critical path spans services (e.g., TS → Python → Go → Rust)
- ✅ Race detection works across services
- ✅ Happens-before relationships respect distributed edges
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ Distributed tests show full graph connectivity

**Code References:**
- `core/src/event.rs:19` - DistributedEdge struct
- `core/src/graph.rs` - CausalGraph implementation
- `core/src/analysis.rs:316-447` - Recursive BFS (already fetches distributed_edges)

---

#### 3. Add Config Toggle for Distributed Tracing

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Current Situation:**
- `DistributedTracingConfig` exists in `core/src/config.rs:267-276`
- Defaults to `enabled: false`
- **Currently not checked anywhere** - distributed tracing always runs

**What Needs to Change:**

##### 3a. Check Config During Event Ingestion

**File:** `core/src/engine.rs` or wherever events are ingested

```rust
async fn process_event(&self, event: Event, storage: Arc<dyn Storage>) -> Result<()> {
    // ... existing event processing ...

    // Only process distributed metadata if enabled
    if self.config.distributed_tracing.enabled {
        if let Some(ref span_id) = event.metadata.distributed_span_id {
            // Create distributed span
            storage.upsert_distributed_span(...).await?;

            // Create distributed edge if upstream_span_id exists
            if let Some(ref upstream_span) = event.metadata.upstream_span_id {
                storage.upsert_distributed_edge(...).await?;
            }
        }
    }

    // ... rest of processing ...
}
```

##### 3b. Check Config During Graph Construction

**File:** `core/src/analysis.rs:316` (get_trace_with_distributed)

```rust
pub async fn get_trace_with_distributed(
    storage: Arc<dyn Storage>,
    trace_id: Uuid,
    config: &Config,  // NEW parameter
) -> Result<TraceWithAnalysis> {
    let events = if config.distributed_tracing.enabled {
        // Use recursive BFS to merge distributed traces
        merge_distributed_events(storage.clone(), trace_id).await?
    } else {
        // Just get events for this trace_id (existing behavior)
        storage.get_events(trace_id).await?
    };

    // Build graph and analyze
    let distributed_edges = if config.distributed_tracing.enabled {
        storage.get_distributed_edges(trace_id).await?
    } else {
        Vec::new()
    };

    let graph = CausalGraph::from_events_with_distributed(
        events,
        distributed_edges,
        storage.clone()
    ).await?;

    // ... rest of analysis ...
}
```

##### 3c. Document Config Flag

**File:** `core/src/config.rs:264-276`

Update comments to be clear about behavior:

```rust
/// Controls whether distributed tracing is enabled (Phase 2).
///
/// When enabled:
/// - Events with distributed_span_id create spans and edges in distributed tables
/// - Traces are merged across services using recursive BFS
/// - Critical path and race detection span services
/// - Vector clocks track causality across service boundaries
///
/// When disabled:
/// - Each service's events remain isolated
/// - Distributed metadata ignored (backward compatible)
/// - Single-service behavior unchanged
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct DistributedTracingConfig {
    #[serde(default = "default_false")]
    pub enabled: bool,
}
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Config flag `distributed_tracing.enabled = true` enables all Phase 2 features
- ✅ Config flag `distributed_tracing.enabled = false` reverts to Phase 1 behavior
- ✅ Default remains `false` for backward compatibility
- ✅ Demo and tests explicitly enable it

#### 4. Complete Property Tests for Vector Clock Semantics

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Current Situation:**
- 7 vector clock unit tests exist in `core/src/graph.rs` (#[cfg(test)])
- Tests cover merge, concurrent detection, serialization
- Missing: property-based tests for invariants

**What Needs to Change:**

##### 4a. Add proptest Dependency

**File:** `core/Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
proptest = "1.0"
```

##### 4b. Add Property Tests

**File:** `core/src/graph.rs` (in #[cfg(test)] module)

```rust
#[cfg(test)]

    use super::*;
    use proptest::prelude::*;

    // ... existing unit tests ...

            assert_eq_clocks(&merged_ab, &merged_a_bc);
        }
    }

    // Property: Merge is idempotent
    proptest! {
        #[test]
        fn prop_vector_clock_merge_idempotent(clock in prop_vector_clock()) {
            let mut merged = clock.clone();
            merge_vector_clocks(&mut merged, &clock);

            assert_eq_clocks(&merged, &clock);
        }
    }

    // Property: Happens-before is transitive
    proptest! {
        #[test]
        fn prop_happens_before_transitive(

                increment_clock(&mut clock_b, incr);
            }

            let mut clock_c = clock_b.clone();
            for incr in clock_c_increment {
                increment_clock(&mut clock_c, incr);
            }

            // If A ≺ B and B ≺ C, then A ≺ C
            assert!(happens_before(&clock_a, &clock_b));
            assert!(happens_before(&clock_b, &clock_c));
            assert!(happens_before(&clock_a, &clock_c));
        }
    }

    // Property: Concurrent events remain concurrent after merge
    proptest! {

            // If A and B are concurrent
            if !happens_before(&clock_a, &clock_b) && !happens_before(&clock_b, &clock_a) {
                // Merging with a third clock shouldn't make them ordered
                let mut merged_a = clock_a.clone();
                merge_vector_clocks(&mut merged_a, &clock_b);

                // merged_a now dominates both (happens-after both)

    }

    fn assert_eq_clocks(a: &[(String, u64)], b: &[(String, u64)]) {
        let mut sorted_a = a.to_vec();
        let mut sorted_b = b.to_vec();
        sorted_a.sort_by(|x, y| x.0.cmp(&y.0));
        sorted_b.sort_by(|x, y| x.0.cmp(&y.0));
        assert_eq!(sorted_a, sorted_b);
    }
}
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Property tests validate vector clock invariants
- ✅ Commutativity, associativity, idempotency proven
- ✅ Happens-before transitivity verified
- ✅ Concurrent events behavior validated
- ✅ Run via `cargo test prop_` to execute property tests

### Phase 2.5 Implementation Order

**Recommended Sequence:**

1. **Task 3: Config Toggle** (2-3 hours) ✅ Low risk, high clarity
   - Easiest to implement
   - Provides gating mechanism for all features
   - Can be tested immediately with existing demo

2. **Task 2: Cross-Service Edges** (4-6 hours) ⚠️ Core functionality
   - Most impactful change
   - Enables critical path and race detection across services
   - Requires careful testing with distributed tests

3. **Task 4: Property Tests** (3-4 hours) ✅ Validation
   - Validates all vector clock logic
   - Catches edge cases
   - Builds confidence in distributed causality

**Total Estimated Effort:** 9-13 hours (1-2 days of focused work)

---

### Phase 2.5 Exit Criteria

**Must Have:**
- ✅ Config flag `distributed_tracing.enabled` controls all Phase 2 features
- ✅ CausalGraph loads and uses distributed edges
- ✅ Critical path spans services in 4-service chain demo
- ✅ Race detection works across service boundaries
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ Distributed tests validate cross-service analysis

**Success Metric:**
```bash
$ cd examples/distributed && ./patterns/full-chain.sh

# With distributed_tracing.enabled = true:
✅ Critical Path Analysis:
  Total Duration: 127ms
  Path:
    1. TypeScript: HTTP /chain (45ms)
    2. Python: HTTP /process (38ms)      ← SPANS SERVICES!
    3. Go: HTTP /transform (29ms)
    4. Rust: HTTP /finalize (15ms)

✅ Race Detection:
  Detected 0 races across 4 services

✅ Vector Clocks:
  typescript-service#ts-1: 4
  python-service#py-1: 3
  go-service#go-1: 2
  rust-service#rust-1: 1
```

**When Phase 2.5 Complete:**
- Distributed tracing is **production-ready**
- All causal analysis works across services
- Config flag provides clean opt-in/opt-out
- Comprehensive test coverage validates correctness

---

## Phase 3 – UI & Analytics

### Terminal UI

- Service-aware trace list (show service count).
- Graph view grouping nodes by service with color coding.
- Critical path spanning services.
- Alert when edges missing (header loss).

### Web UI

- Update service dependency graph to use distributed edges.
- Timeline overlay per service.
- Filters for service/operation.

### API

- `/api/traces/:id` responses include distributed edges and service metadata.
- New endpoints (optional) for service-level metrics (e.g., `/api/services/:name/dependencies`).

### Testing

- Snapshot tests for API payloads.
- Cypress/Playwright flows verifying multi-service trace visualization.
- TUI golden tests (ratatui) verifying layout with distributed data.

**Exit criteria:** Users can inspect multi-service traces end-to-end in both UIs.

---

## Phase 4 – Advanced Propagation & Resilience

- gRPC interceptors for all SDKs.
- Message queue/staged propagation (Kafka headers, etc.).
- Fallback clocks when headers missing (generate synthetic spans, mark as incomplete).
- Replay support: ability to rehydrate distributed traces from storage into engine.
- Telemetry & observability: metrics for header adoption, drop rate, clock conflict warnings.

### Tests

- End-to-end scenario: service A → gRPC → service B → Kafka → service C.
- Chaos tests: randomly drop headers to ensure system degrades gracefully.
- Load tests to measure impact on ingestion and storage.
